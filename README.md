# Olamreee

We went on a field trip to Mars in chemistry class, but somehow the ship missed Mars and crashed on a planet known as Olam. Fortunately, we can stay alive on the planet for a little while.

The locals don't have a chemistry textbook for some reason, so they offered to exchange fuel for a chemistry textbook written by us. For some reason our teacher thought this was a great deal, so the locals gave us their list of their known elements; somehow they even figured out almost all of the elements' ionization energies.

Hence the name of this web app.
